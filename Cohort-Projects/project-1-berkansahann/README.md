# Real Estate Project

Project assignments:

Create 3 types of Real Estates: House, Villa, and Summer House. Within a class, create at least 3 objects of House, Villa, and Summer House, and write methods that return these instances to you (getHouseList, getVillaList, etc.).

Inside a service class, write the following methods:

* A method that returns the total price of houses
* A method that returns the total price of villas
* A method that returns the total price of summer houses
* A method that returns the total price of all types of houses
* A method that returns the average square meter of houses
* A method that returns the average square meter of villas
* A method that returns the average square meter of summer houses
* A method that returns the average square meter of all types of houses
* A method that filters and returns all types of real estates based on the number of rooms and living rooms
